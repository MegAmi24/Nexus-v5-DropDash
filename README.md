# Nexus v5 Drop Dash
Mod for [Sonic Nexus v5](https://github.com/MegAmi24/Sonic-Nexus-v5) that adds the Drop Dash. Made as an example of using the C++ GameAPI for mods. See [this document](https://github.com/MegAmi24/Mania-Decomp-Mods/blob/main/BUILDING.md) for a building guide.

Special thanks to [Jdsle](https://github.com/Jdsle) for helping me figure out a couple things with C++ mods.
